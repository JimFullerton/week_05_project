# Banff & Macduff Business Directory

The Banff & Macduff Heritage Trail is an initiative by Aberdeenshire council aimed at raising the profile of the local area and fostering community.
The project comprises three principal parts: installation of a set of interpretation panels, a mobile app-based walking tour, and a dynamic community website.
The website will contain, among other things; practical information, historical features, heritage stories, and a "what's on" section, which will include a "shop local" feature.

For the "shop local" feature, the client is looking for a searchable display-list of digital business cards from local businesses to be made available.

A CSV file of seed data has been provided.

#### MVP:

* A list of all the businesses can be displayed
* Businesses displayed can be filtered by type

#### Possible Extensions:

* A separate admin page displays the businesses
* New businesses can be added on the admin page
* Businesses on the admin page can be edited
* Businesses on the admin page can be deleted
